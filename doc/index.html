<h2>ARC4</h2>
<h2>The current version is 0.1 (April 19, 2001)</h2>
<p><b>ARC4Lib</b> is a free system library for Palm OS.
It contains functions to encrypt/decrypt data using ARC4 (Alleged RC4). 
A complete list of the functions currently provided by the latest version
of ARC4Lib can be found in the <b><a href="ARC4Libmanual.txt" class="blue">
User's Manual</a></b>.
</p>

<p>This library was written as a <b>system library</b>
(<i>not</i> in GLib format) for benefiting the full support from
the latest version of Palm OS and the developing tools.
The system library is supported by the Palm OS SysLib* API calls and is <i>officially</i>
described in Palm OS FAQ <i><a href="http://oasis.palm.com/dev/kb/papers/1143.cfm" class ="blue">
Shared Libraries and Other Advanced Project Types</a></i>.
It is a runtime <b>shared library</b> which allows Palm applications or
other shared libraries using the ARC4Lib functions dynamically. This
in terms saves the applications from keeping copies of the same
code in their own code resources.</p>
<p>Another advantage of implementing those functions in the form of a shared
library is to overcome two memory constraints of Palm OS namely
the 32KB jump limit (CodeWarrior default model) and the code resource
size limit.</p>

<p>Another type of shared libraries is called <b>
<a href="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/pilot/GLib/GLib.html" class ="blue">GLib</a></b>,
which is more user-friendly (or programmer-friendly) than the system library
mentioned above and is also faster because no systraps are done when
calling the GLib functions. However, as of this writing, neither CodeWarrior nor the latest version of
PRC-Tools supports GLibs. Only PRC-Tools 0.5.0 and 
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/computing/pcpqa/m9618.html" class ="blue">Michael Sokolov's 0.6.0 beta</a> do so.
This is also one of the reasons of implementing the library as a system library instead of a GLib.</p>
<h2>How to Use?</h2>
<p>
If you just want to use the ARC4Lib with your Palm programs,
simply follow the steps below to download the files and learn how to use them.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the PRC file,
<a href="ARC4Lib.prc" class ="blue" >ARC4Lib.prc</a> 
and install it to your Palm Pilot.</li>
<li>Download header files, <a href="ARC4Lib.h" class ="blue">ARC4Lib.h</a>
Your Palm program needs to include the <b>ARC4Lib.h</b> header file. </li>
<li>Finally, download <a href="ARC4Libmanual.txt" class ="blue">ARC4Lib User's Manual</a>
  and learn the library functions. I'll polish a better one when I have time. </li>
</ol>

<p>
We have only tested the library on the Palm V and Palm IIIc with Palm OS v3.3 and Palm OS v3.5 so far.
So your feedbacks of running the library on other Palm devices are
welcome. This library is in the public domain. You can distribute, copy or
modify the code as you will. I would also appreciate any comments, bug reports
and enhancements.
