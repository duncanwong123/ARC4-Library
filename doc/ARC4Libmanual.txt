Description:

ARC4Lib is a Palm OS Library that implements ARC4 (Alleged RC4).

To use this Palm Library, you need to:

1.  Download the ARC4Lib.prc
2.  Download the ARC4Lib.h
3.  Only include the ARC4Lib.h in your project.

How to use the ARC4Lib:

1. First you need to open the Library. 
The sample code is as follows:

	err = SysLibFind("ARC4Library", &ARC4LibRefNum);
	if (err) err = SysLibLoad('libr', 'HRC4', &ARC4LibRefNum);
	ErrFatalDisplayIf(err, "Cannot load ARC4 Library");
	err = ARC4Open(ARC4LibRefNum);

Where ARC4LibRefNum is a static UInt16, used to store where is 
the ARC4Library.

We sugest that you put this code in your StartApplication() function, or
in the function you use to initialize your application.

2.  How to use ARC4?

You need to create a variable that will contain some of the ARC4 info.  
We have created a special type:
ARC4_CTX.

Example:

ARC4_CTX key_ctx;

Also, you need to Initialize ARC4 and then you can call the
Encryption/Decryption functions.

After you finish, you need to close the library.

3.  How to Initialize ARC4?

This is done via the function:
ARC4Initialize(UInt16 refNum, unsigned char * keystring, int keysize, ARC4_CTX * key) 

ARC4Initialize has the following parameters:

UInt16 refNum:  This is the reference number of the library.
unsigned char * keystring: This is string with the key.
int keysize:  This signals the size of the key.
ARC4_CTX * key:  In this variable we will store the key and other internal
information about ARC4.

4. How to Encrypt/Decrypt?

To Encrypt or Decrypt, we have declared two functions:

To Encrypt we use the function:

ARC4Encrypt(UInt16 refNum, ARC4_CTX * key, unsigned char * in, unsigned
char * out, unsigned long size)

The parameters are as follows:

UInt16 refNum:  The reference number of this library.  Obtain when you
open the library.

ARC4_CTX * key:  This is the context information about ARC4.  You need to
initialize it before using it in Encrypt or Decrypt.

unsigned char * in:  This is a pointer to the input string.

unsigned char * out:  This is a pointer to where the output should be
written.  The user has to allocate this memory.

unsigned long size:  This is the size of the data to be encrypted.  This
size is denoted in number of Bytes to be encrypted.

To decrypt, the function is

ARC4Decrypt(UInt16 refNum, ARC4_CTX * key, unsigned char * in, unsigned
char * out, unsigned long size)

and the parameters are the same.

NOTE:  The user is responsible in deallocating any memory created for the
input and output strings.

5.  How to Close the Library?

You can close the library when you finished.  This is accomplished via:

	error = ARC4Close(ARC4LibRefNum, &numapps);  
	// check for erros in the Close() routine
	if (numapps == 0)
		SysLibRemove(ARC4LibRefNum);

We suggest you include this code in the StopApplication() function
or your function used to handle the case of closing the application.
